        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The term <strong>"metaphysics"</strong> originates from Aristotle’s work <em>Metaphysics</em>, a book written after his <em>Physics</em>. However, despite being written later, <em>Metaphysics</em> serves as a foundational framework that retrospectively grounds his physical theories. The term itself is a compound of <strong>“meta-”</strong> (meaning beyond, higher, or foundational) and <strong>“physics”</strong> (which in its original sense referred to the study of nature and the fundamental principles of reality).</p>

        <h2>Traditional Metaphysics: A Boring Endeavor?</h2>
        <p>Classical metaphysics thrived before the advent of modern physics. During this period, <strong>"physics"</strong> did not refer to the empirical, mathematical discipline we know today but rather to a general inquiry into the principles governing all things.</p>
        <p>Unlike modern physics, which relies on experimental verification, ancient physics was highly speculative, resembling a world-building exercise with low abstraction and high classification.</p>

        <h2>Metaphysics as an Intellectual Aristocracy</h2>
        <p>Ancient philosophers, constrained by their available methodologies, constructed ontological models as if they were writing family sagas or mythic dramas. Rather than relying on empirical verification, they assigned causal relationships based on conceptual resemblance.</p>
        <p>Consequently, metaphysics became an intricate yet rigid taxonomy of reality—one that lacked rigorous validation. However, despite these limitations, metaphysics developed internal logical rigor, fostering methods such as deduction and paradoxical analysis.</p>

        <h2>The Discovery of Reality’s Dual Structure</h2>
        <p>One of metaphysics’ greatest achievements was its recognition of a fundamental <strong>split in the order of reality</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reality consists of both an <strong>external world</strong> and an <strong>internal world</strong>, but their relationship is not additive (external + internal ≠ totality).</li>
            <li>Either the external world alone or the internal world alone can be considered the whole.</li>
            <li>One part of reality becomes a <strong>symbolic system</strong>, something grasped by thought and encoded into language.</li>
            <li>The other part remains non-symbolized, an irreducible remainder resisting conceptualization.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Metaphysics and the Symbolic Order</h2>
        <p>Whenever a symbolic system is constructed, there is always something left out—an unaccounted-for remainder. This is why metaphysical thought constantly wrestles with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>symbolic order</strong>: an invisible structure governing reality.</li>
            <li>The <strong>remainder</strong>: the background of reality that cannot be symbolized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, in Aristotle’s thought:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fate</strong> represents the symbolic order—an unseen force dictating the cosmos.</li>
            <li><strong>Economy</strong> represents the governance of human society.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Metaphysics as an Aristocratic Intellectual Enterprise</h2>
        <p>Metaphysical discourse has always been an elitist intellectual pursuit—a noble attempt at refinement rather than a radical ideology.</p>
        <p>It is too intricate to serve as mass political doctrine. Unlike simplified ideologies that can be widely propagated, metaphysics is fragile—like a delicate figurine that breaks if handled roughly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Metaphysics: Superior to Empirical Inquiry, Inferior to Idealism</h2>
        <p>Metaphysics surpasses empirical inquiry in its ability to grasp the background split in reality. However, it falls short compared to idealism because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It assumes that the subject is merely a <strong>neutral observer</strong>, harmonizing the split between symbolic order and remainder.</li>
            <li>Idealism reveals that subjectivity itself is the <strong>crucial mediator</strong>—a force that reshapes metaphysics entirely.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Classical metaphysics laid the foundation for later philosophical inquiry. Yet, it remained trapped in the assumption that reality could be systematized without acknowledging the role of subjectivity. Idealism, by contrast, reveals that the subject’s engagement is not incidental but central to the very structure of reality itself.</p>
