        <h1>Thales and Universalism</h1>
        <h2>The True Origin of Philosophy, Science, Mathematics, and Logic</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Thales is regarded as the first philosopher of presence-based metaphysics and the first natural philosopher. He is also considered the first scientist, marking the inception of rational inquiry. His advocacy of rational thought defines his epistemological stance. The rejection of myth was a defining moment in philosophy, as myths were seen as pre-reflective explanations. Rational thinking enables one to transcend mythology and seek coherence in symbolic systems.</p>

        <h2>The Unity of Symbolic Systems</h2>
        <p>The consistency of symbolic systems implies a dynamic process—a self-division within metaphysical space. This manifests as two dimensions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logos</strong>: The pre-symbolic dimension of fate.</li>
            <li><strong>The Order of the World</strong>: The structured system of reality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Logos exerts a symbolic force upon the order of reality, and the subject’s grasp of this process is what we call reason. Universalism, in epistemology, represents this unidirectional motion.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Universalism and Rational Inquiry</h2>
        <p>This motion forms the core of Western rationalism and the foundation of scientific thought. Unlike traditional education, which often reinforces authority, universalism asserts that knowledge is accessible to all. Regardless of social status, one’s ability to apply reason grants an unconditional right to interpret the world.</p>
        <p>Universalism stands in opposition to pre-reflective traditions that prioritize particularity and inherited structures. Some have falsely opposed universalism to relativism, but relativism is the antithesis of absolutism. Universalism challenges unexamined traditions, those that serve only to preserve elite interests.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Thales as a Precursor to Modern Science</h2>
        <p>Thales embodies the universalist spirit. He was, in essence, an early Newton—both were natural philosophers seeking to explain all phenomena through mathematical and physical principles. His contributions, including measuring the height of pyramids through shadows and determining the distance of ships at sea, exemplify his universalist approach. Through mathematical abstraction, he connected the entire world within a single symbolic system.</p>

        <h2>The Structure of Universalism</h2>
        <p>Universalism operates through three dimensions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cosmos vs. Topos</strong>: The distinction between the material universe and the symbolic domain.</li>
            <li><strong>Presence</strong>: The foundation of being, where all things derive their legitimacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Phenomenon</strong>: The universal rational structure that orders cognition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To comprehend reality, one must map the cosmos into the topos, the symbolic space where thought occurs. This mapping process enables structured propositions, allowing the formulation of knowledge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Topos and the Rationalization of Reality</h2>
        <p>Symbolic space is the projection of the cosmos. Universalism does not seek to analyze every detail of reality but rather extracts meaningful structures and maps them into topos. The term “topology” originates from “topos,” and it signifies the process of rendering concrete phenomena into propositional thought.</p>
        <p>Through rational inquiry, all things can be subjected to a symbolic framework. The process of topologization is the act of imposing structure upon reality. Without topos, the cosmos remains unintelligible, as the symbolic domain is the prerequisite for comprehension.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Pursuit of Rational Universality</h2>
        <p>Universalists believe that rationality can illuminate all things. If reason is universal, then causality must also be universal and unconditional. Through reasoning and proof, humans connect causes and effects, enabling the symbolic structure to envelop the material world.</p>
        <p>This belief in the comprehensibility of reality forms the foundation of scientific rationalism. The principle that discovered laws can be generalized is central to scientific progress. Although universalism has reductionist tendencies, it does not equate to reductionism. It requires constant intellectual activity to maintain the connection between topos and cosmos, preventing knowledge from becoming fragmented.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Role of Mathematics in Universalism</h2>
        <p>Under universalist thought, rational inquiry gradually detaches symbolic structures from their empirical constraints. This phenomenon is evident in mathematics, where geometric figures like triangles and circles do not exist in reality but serve as conceptual tools. Through axioms and logical derivation, mathematicians establish relationships between abstract entities, demonstrating the autonomy of symbolic structures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Limitations of Pre-Modern Universalism</h2>
        <p>Although universalism has historically driven intellectual advancement, early thinkers often misinterpreted contingent phenomena as necessary truths. In primitive societies, social structures were relatively uniform, making generalization effective. However, as societies grew more complex, the assumption of universally applicable laws became problematic.</p>
        <p>Misapplications of universalism occur when historical contingencies are mistaken for necessary structures. Some resist modernization based on a romanticized view of tradition, failing to recognize that societal evolution is driven by the emergence of novel contingencies that challenge existing structures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Universalism and Subjectivity</h2>
        <p>Universalism assumes the legitimacy of the logos, the underlying order governing the cosmos. However, it does not recognize that logos itself is retrospectively constructed by subjectivity. The perceived rational order is not an external reality but an effect of the subject’s engagement with the world.</p>
        <p>Metaphysical systems fail when they assume that causality operates without an originating act. The first link in the causal chain is always a self-referential gesture imposed by subjectivity. Early metaphysicians lacked the historical conditions to reflect on this limitation, treating established structures as self-evident.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Thales and the Birth of Rational Thought</h2>
        <p>Thales’ contributions are often reduced to his assertion that “all is water” and anecdotes about his practical ingenuity. However, his philosophical importance lies in his break from mythological thinking. In a world dominated by polytheism and animism, he proposed a unified principle governing all things. This was not naive materialism but a radical departure from the fragmented spiritualism of his time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Legacy of Universalist Thought</h2>
        <p>Despite its achievements, universalism has its blind spots. It fails to acknowledge that its totality is inherently incomplete. The act of universalization is always mediated by subjectivity, making it an ongoing process rather than a static framework.</p>
        <p>Universalism, by its very nature, generates dialectical thinking. The symbolic system is self-referential, built upon an initial act of differentiation. However, early metaphysicians did not recognize this self-referential structure. Their historical context did not yet provide the necessary crises and transformations to reveal the constructed nature of their categories.</p>

        <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
        <p>Engage with the ideas presented in this article by reflecting on the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Thales rejected mythological explanations in favor of rational inquiry. In what ways does modern science still wrestle with remnants of mythological thinking?</strong></li>
            <li><strong>2. Universalism assumes that rationality is accessible to all. Can knowledge truly be democratized, or are there inherent barriers that restrict access to rational inquiry?</strong></li>
            <li><strong>3. Thales' work relied on abstraction and mathematical principles. To what extent can mathematical models fully capture the complexities of reality?</strong></li>
            <li><strong>4. Does the distinction between the cosmos (material world) and topos (symbolic world) remain valid in contemporary philosophy and science?</strong></li>
            <li><strong>5. In what ways has the universalist perspective contributed to both the advancement and limitations of modern knowledge?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These questions are intended to spark discussion and further exploration. Feel free to share your thoughts and engage in dialogue with others.</p>
